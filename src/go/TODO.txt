Maintain the preplist.txt after I try it out on 2010B
Add code in go.py to automatically generate the required number of code placeholders
Get the Java client from le francais (says sometime in Feb)
Finish implementing 2010A (improve & understand B & C)

After this year upload what I have to github (add gitignore file for first commit)
